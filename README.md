# 🌐 hashwithharsh — DevOps Portfolio

Personal portfolio website documenting my journey to becoming a **DevOps & Cloud Engineer**.

This project demonstrates a **secure, serverless architecture** combining **GitHub Pages** and **Vercel serverless functions**.
It allows me to publish projects and blogs while keeping authentication and sensitive tokens secure.

The website is built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without frameworks to keep deployment simple and lightweight.


# Short 20-second explanation..
this project is a personal DevOps portfolio using a serverless architecture. The frontend is hosted on GitHub Pages while the backend runs as serverless functions on Vercel. The backend handles authentication using bcrypt and JWT and securely pushes blog and project updates to the GitHub repository using the GitHub API. This architecture separates frontend, backend, and secret management while keeping deployment simple and cost-efficient.

### Explanation

**GitHub Pages**

* Hosts the static frontend (`index.html`)
* Serves the portfolio UI

**Vercel**

* Runs serverless backend APIs
* Handles authentication and GitHub operations

**GitHub Repository**

* Stores projects and blog data
* Updated through the backend API

This architecture separates **frontend, backend, and data storage** for better security and scalability.

# 🔐 Security Features

The project implements multiple security best practices.

### Password Hashing

Passwords are not stored directly.

They are hashed using **bcrypt**.

```
bcrypt(password) → hash
```

Only the hash is stored in environment variables.

---

### JWT Authentication

After login, the server generates a **JWT token** used for authenticated API requests.

Advantages:

* Stateless authentication
* Secure session handling
* Token expiration for safety

---

### Environment Variables

Sensitive data is stored in **Vercel environment variables** instead of the frontend.

Examples:

* `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
* `JWT_SECRET`
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`
* `GITHUB_USERNAME`
* `GITHUB_REPO`
* `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`

This prevents secrets from being exposed in the browser.

---

### Rate Limiting

Login endpoint includes protection against brute-force attacks.

Example policy:

```
5 failed attempts → temporary lockout
```

---

# 🧑‍💻 Admin Panel

The website includes a **hidden admin CMS**.

It allows publishing:

* Blog posts
* Projects
* Screenshots
* Project updates

Admin panel is intentionally hidden from normal visitors.

### Access Method 1

```
https://hashwithharsh.github.io/#admin
```

### Access Method 2

Type the keyboard sequence:

```
H A R S H
```

This opens the login modal.

# ⚙️ Deployment

## Frontend

Hosted using **GitHub Pages**

```
https://hashwithharsh.github.io
```

Deployment happens automatically after pushing commits.

---

## Backend

Hosted using **Vercel Serverless Functions**

Endpoints:

```
POST /api/login
POST /api/push
GET  /api/status
```

The backend securely communicates with the GitHub API.

# 🔄 Content Publishing Flow

```
Admin writes blog/project
        │
        ▼
Frontend sends API request
        │
        ▼
Vercel API authenticates request
        │
        ▼
GitHub API creates commit
        │
        ▼
GitHub Pages rebuilds site
        │
        ▼
New content goes live
```

This workflow mimics a **CI/CD publishing pipeline**.
